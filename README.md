# DeerHacks

Our project for the MCSS Deerhacks 2022 hackathon.

Team members: Owais Zahid and Mahmood Saifi. 

Our goal here is simple. Latex is pretty hard for a beginner to learn how to use, and even experienced users find it tiresome to be reaching for the backslash or curly braces when typing out their undergraduate Math assignment, or polishing their resum√©. Here's how we can help. Our Deerhacks project revolves around parsing text provided by the user in a convenient, non-technical form and converts it to Latex, so that you never have to worry about the details when adding flavor to your document.
