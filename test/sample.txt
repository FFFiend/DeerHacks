# Hello, World!

###* Problem 1

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Define $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as $f(x) = x^2$.
We will show that this function is not uniformly continuous.

... Show it ...

On the other hand, consider $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $g(x) = x^2$.
We will show that this function *is* uniformly continuous.

... Show it ...

Thus, we conclude: **the *domain* of a function is __really__ important!**
